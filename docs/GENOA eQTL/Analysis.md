##### Most existing expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping studies have been focused on individuals of European ancestry, but are underrepresented in other populations including populations with African ancestry. 

##### In this study, we fill this critical knowledge gap by performing a large-scale in-depth eQTL mapping study on 1,032 African Americans (AA) and 801 European Americans (EA) in the GENOA cohort. 

##### Overall, our results represent an important step towards revealing the genetic architecture underlying expression variation in African Americans.â€ƒ
