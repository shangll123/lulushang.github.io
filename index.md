****My name is Lulu Shang. I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, advised by Prof. [Xiang Zhou](http://xzlab.org). My research interests center around the development and application of statistical and computational methods for genetic and genomic studies such as spatially resolved transcriptomics studies.
